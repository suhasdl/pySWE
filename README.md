# pySWE
A python based framework for solving the spherical shallow water equations (SWE).
Example scripts for solving more linear Matsuno-Gill like problem as well as a non-linear turbulent case are included.
Moist shallow water code is included now.

Plot utilities include some commonly used functions used for analysing the data. 
It includes Wheeler-Kiladis plot, wave filtering, energy spectral anlaysis and so on.

Some of the results which can be generated by pySWE.
